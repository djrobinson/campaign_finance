Notes:

Works straight from download:
committee_registrations
ccl.txt

Has extra data after last expected column Issue:
campaign_cmte_rpts
candidiate_summaries
committee_summaries
oppexp.txt < SOLVED: Had to remove extra '|', removed final rows. \COPY vs COPY issue


Has number format issue:
candidate_disbursements < SOLVED: negative number issue

Note, it appears there is a difference between \COPY & COPY for postgres
