\COPY committee_master FROM '/Users/danny/Downloads/cm.txt' (DELIMITER('|'));

Notes:

Works straight from download:
committee_registrations
ccl.txt
cn.txt
cm.txt < Minor issue w/ '\'
itoth.txt
itcont.txt < '\' issue
itpas2.txt

Has extra data after last expected column Issue:
campaign_cmte_rpts
candidiate_summaries
committee_summaries
oppexp.txt < SOLVED: Had to remove extra '|', removed final rows. \COPY vs COPY issue, '\' issue

Missing data for column "..." issue:
independent_expenditures.csv
candidate_registratios.csv


Has number format issue:
candidate_disbursements < SOLVED: negative number issue, restructured the currency formatter

Other note: some bulk txt files have backslashes that need to be removed

Note, it appears there is a difference between \COPY & COPY for postgres
