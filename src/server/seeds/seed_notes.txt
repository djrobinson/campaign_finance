Notes:

Works straight from download:
committee_registrations
ccl.txt
cn.txt
cm.txt < Minor issue w/ '\'
itoth.txt < Date format
itcont.txt < '\' issue
itpas2.txt
oppexp.txt < SOLVED: Had to remove extra '|', removed final rows. \COPY vs COPY issue, '\' issue
candidate_disbursements < SOLVED: negative number issue, restructured the currency formatter

Has extra data after last expected column Issue:
campaign_cmte_rpts <SOLVED: Had extra comma at the end of each line
candidiate_summaries <Gonna take some work: A lot of extra quotes. getting an "Unterminated quoted csv" error on last line. Can't find where it opened.
committee_summaries. *New update: Might need to do this one manually. A lot of extra quotes for nicknames

*Candidate Summaries solution: Ran into the unterminnated quote error. Created file to test quote parity called count_quotes.js. Also need to do a search, changing quotes @ ," & ", to single quotes, then search for nicknames. After eliminating the nicknames, change back. Also note some nicknames have random commas that need to be manually searched for.

Missing data for column "..." issue:
independent_expenditures.csv  < Solved: Deleted blank rows at end of file
candidate_registrations.csv <Solved: Same deal. Deleted blank rows.

Other note: some bulk txt files have backslashes that need to be removed. Will be too large for buffer size.

Note, it appears there is a difference between \COPY & COPY for postgres
See the following article:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26747748/error-missing-data-for-column-when-using-copy-in-psql

NOTES ON QUERYING:
Appears that columns w/ knex are created w/ double quotes. therefore, need to use the following structure when running manual queries:
SELECT * FROM indiv_contrib where "CMTE_ID" = 'C00452383';

NOTES ON DATE FORMATTING:
Created format file, but itoth is too large to be processed. Will try to seed db anyway.

Killing process of long running query: SELECT pg_cancel_backend(17683);
