      - <li>The operating expenditures treemap represents all funds spent by a given committee</li>
      <li>- The overall size of the rectangle represents all funds spent by the committee. Each smaller rectangle represents the portion of funds that were given to just one recipient.</li>
      <li>- Clicking each rectangle will show a transaction by transaction breakout of each expense.</li>
      <li>- How to navigate it</li>
