# Campaign Finance Explorer App
##Overview
I want to create a Campaign Finance data visualization projects to explore some of the largest donors to political campaigns.  My project will focus specifically on the largest SuperPACs involved in the current presidential campaign to reduce the scope of the exploration.  I will be integrating with publicly available FEC apis (also a few New York Times APIs) that show all information on political donations. At a very minimum I would like to create a network-style data visualization that will show the flow of funds from donor to pac to candidate. If I have time I would also like to show detail on each node.
